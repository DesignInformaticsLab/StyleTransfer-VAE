# StyleTransfer-VAE
# Summary of the proposed VAE + Style Transfer Network
## Purpose
The proposed VAE + Style Transfer Network is trained to be a generator, 
which could help us generate images with similar style compared with input samples and also the network could reconstruct the original images, unlike GAN which couldn't satisfy the reconstruction requirement.
